# Template Base Directory

This directory will contain the base template for full-stack applications generated with the Template-Based Strategy.

The template provides:
- Root monorepo structure with npm workspaces
- Minimal Vite + React 19 client
- Minimal Express 5 server
- Basic Prisma schema setup
- Configuration files (tsconfig, vite.config, etc.)

The LLM will customize and extend this template based on user requirements, significantly reducing token usage and improving consistency.
