# Claude Context Document

## Project Overview

This is Gen Fullstack - an experimental LLM-powered full-stack application generator. It generates complete, working full-stack applications with:
- **Client**: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Server**: Express 5 + TypeScript + RESTful API
- **Database**: Prisma ORM + SQLite

The system provides a real-time interface for generating applications using different prompting strategies and tool-calling approaches, with Docker-based execution for immediate previewing.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript + Socket.IO + Express
- **AI**: Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI models
- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces

```

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Communication
- WebSocket-based bidirectional communication via Socket.IO
- Events stream from server to client:
  - `llm_message` - LLM responses
  - `tool_call` - Tool invocations
  - `tool_result` - Tool execution results
  - `file_updated` - Generated file updates
  - `generation_complete` - Generation finished with metrics

### 2. Unified Timeline
- Chronologically ordered display of all LLM messages and tool calls
- Real timestamps (Unix milliseconds) for accurate sequencing
- Expandable tool call details via modal dialogs (Radix UI)
- Semantic color coding for different message roles:
  - **Blue**: Assistant messages
  - **Gray**: User messages and tool calls
  - **Amber**: System messages

### 3. Generation Strategies
Multiple approaches to full-stack app generation (extensible):
- **Naive**: Direct prompt-to-code generation of complete full-stack apps
- **Plan First**: Generate architectural plan (database schema, API endpoints, components) before implementation
- **With Template**: Start from pre-built full-stack template (future)
- **Compiler Checks**: Self-correct with TypeScript errors (future)
- **Building Blocks**: Use higher-level components (future)

All strategies generate monorepo structure with npm workspaces:
```
generated/session-id/
├── package.json       (root with workspaces, concurrently)
├── .env               (DATABASE_URL)
├── client/            (Vite + React)
├── server/            (Express 5 + TypeScript)
└── prisma/            (schema + migrations)
```

### 4. LLM Tools
File system tools available to the LLM:
- `readFile` - Read file contents
- `writeFile` - Create/update files
- `listFiles` - List directory contents
- `executeCommand` - Run shell commands

### 5. Design System
Centralized design tokens in `client/src/lib/design-tokens.ts`:
- **Semantic colors**: Role-based color palette (assistant, user, system, tool)
- **Typography**: Consistent text styles (header, label, body, caption, mono)
- **Spacing**: Standardized spacing scales (sections, controls, form, list, cards)
- **Radius**: Border radius tokens (sm, md)
- **Focus states**: Consistent focus ring styles
- **Transitions**: Standard transition durations

### 6. App Execution (Phase 4)
Docker-based secure execution of generated full-stack apps:
- **Docker Service** (`server/src/services/docker.service.ts`):
  - Container lifecycle management (create, start, stop, destroy)
  - Dual-port mapping: client (5173) and server (3000) mapped to host ports 5001-5200
  - Resource limits and security constraints
  - Log streaming and event forwarding
  - Automatic cleanup with configurable timeouts

- **Process Service** (`server/src/services/process.service.ts`):
  - Simplified API for full-stack app execution
  - Dependency installation (npm install for monorepo + workspaces)
  - Prisma client generation and database migrations
  - Dev server management (npm run dev with concurrently for client + server)
  - Event forwarding to WebSocket clients

- **Preview Proxy** (`server/src/index.ts`):
  - HTTP proxy: `/preview/:sessionId/*` → container client port (Vite)
  - WebSocket proxy for Vite HMR
  - Error handling and status checks

- **Security Model**:
  - Isolated Docker containers per session
  - Non-root user execution
  - Dropped Linux capabilities
  - Resource limits (512MB RAM, 1 CPU)
  - Network isolation via Docker
  - Read-only root filesystem

### 7. Storybook Component Development
Storybook 9.1+ for isolated component development and testing:

**Configuration**:
- Uses `@storybook/react-vite` (Storybook 9.0+ with React + Vite)
- Story files: `*.stories.tsx` in component directories
- Runs independently from main app

**TypeScript Configuration**:
```typescript
// IMPORTANT: In Storybook 9.0+, import from @storybook/react-vite, not @storybook/react
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react-vite';

const meta = {
  title: 'Components/MyComponent',
  component: MyComponent,
} satisfies Meta<typeof MyComponent>;

export default meta;
type Story = StoryObj<typeof meta>;

export const Default: Story = {
  args: {
    // component props
  },
};
```

**Key Components with Stories**:
- `EmptyState` - Reusable empty state with icon, title, description
- `FilterButton` - Filter buttons with color variants
- `AppControls`, `AppPreview`, `LogViewer` - App execution UI
- `Timeline`, `FileViewer`, `PromptInput` - Generation UI
- `ErrorBoundary`, `ToastProvider` - Error handling

**Best Practices**:
- All new UI components should have Storybook stories
- Use design tokens for consistent styling
- Include multiple variants showing different states
- Document props with JSDoc comments
- Use `satisfies` operator for type safety

## Recent Changes

### Full-Stack App Generator Upgrade (Latest - January 2025) ✅
Complete upgrade from single-app generator to full-stack application generator:

**Architecture Changes**:
- Updated all strategy prompts (naive, plan-first) to generate full-stack monorepo apps
- Client: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript
- Server: Express 5 + TypeScript with automatic async error handling
- Database: Prisma ORM + SQLite for simplicity
- Monorepo: npm workspaces with concurrently for parallel dev servers

**Docker Configuration**:
- Updated runner.Dockerfile with Prisma CLI support
- Dual-port mapping: container ports 5173 (Vite) and 3000 (Express) → host ports 5001-5200
- Vite runs with `--host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173` flags (passed via root package.json dev:client script)
- **NPM Cache Optimization**: Pre-populated npm cache with common dependencies (React, Express, Prisma, Vite, TypeScript, etc.) reduces install time from ~60s to ~10-15s

**Process Execution**:
- 3-step dependency installation:
  1. `npm install` (root + workspaces)
  2. `npx prisma generate` (generate Prisma client)
  3. `npx prisma migrate dev --name init` (run database migrations)
- Dev server execution: `npm run dev` (uses concurrently to run both client and server)

**Type System Updates**:
- Updated `AppInfo` interface with dual-port architecture:
  - `clientPort` and `clientUrl` for Vite dev server
  - `serverPort` and `serverUrl` for Express API
- Removed backward compatibility fields (old `port` and `url`)

**Preview Proxy**:
- Updated to use `clientPort` for HTTP/WebSocket proxying
- Proper error handling for missing port configuration

**Testing**:
- All 133 tests passing with new dual-port architecture
- Updated Docker service tests for full-stack setup
- Updated client component tests and Storybook stories

**Documentation**:
- Updated CLAUDE.md with full-stack architecture details
- Updated strategy prompts with latest best practices (Express 5, Prisma 6, React 19, Vite 7)

### Phase 4: Docker-Based App Execution (Production Ready ✅)
- **Docker Service**: Production-ready container management with comprehensive security
  - Build and manage runner images with automatic detection (Colima, Docker Desktop, Linux)
  - Socket path validation with symlink resolution (TOCTOU attack prevention)
  - Path whitelisting (/var/run, ~/.colima, ~/.docker only)
  - Create isolated containers with resource limits (512MB RAM, 1 CPU core)
  - Dual-port mapping: client and server (ports 5001-5200)
  - Real-time log streaming with correct Docker multiplexed stream format
  - Buffer accumulation for partial stream chunks
  - Memory leak prevention: cleanup functions for all event listeners, timers, streams
  - Automatic cleanup with configurable timeouts (10 min max runtime)
  - Security: non-root user, dropped all capabilities, no-new-privileges flag

- **Process Service**: High-level app lifecycle management
  - Start/stop/restart apps with full error handling
  - Install dependencies (npm install) with 2-minute timeout
  - Start dev servers (npm run dev) with readiness detection
  - Forward logs and build events via EventEmitter
  - Graceful error handling with status tracking
  - Auto-cleanup tracking (timers, intervals, streams)

- **WebSocket Integration**: App execution commands
  - `start_app` - Create container, install deps, start dev server
  - `stop_app` - Stop and destroy container with cleanup
  - `restart_app` - Restart running app
  - `app_status` - Container status updates (creating, installing, starting, running, failed, stopped)
  - `app_log` - Real-time logs from containers (stdout/stderr)
  - `build_event` - Build success/failure events

- **Preview Proxy**: HTTP/WebSocket proxy to containers
  - Route `/preview/:sessionId/*` to container ports
  - WebSocket support for Vite HMR
  - Error handling for stopped/failed apps
  - DNS rebinding protection compatibility (Vite)

- **Security Hardening** (All Critical Issues Fixed):
  1. ✅ Socket path injection prevention (symlink resolution, whitelisting, type verification)
  2. ✅ Memory leak prevention (tracked cleanup for streams, timers, intervals)
  3. ✅ Race condition elimination (proper async resource management)
  4. ✅ Correct stream processing (Docker multiplexed format with buffer handling)
  5. ✅ Container isolation (dropped capabilities, non-root, resource limits)

- **Comprehensive Testing**: **133/133 tests passing** ✅
  - Docker service tests (24/24 passing) ✅
  - Process service tests (21/21 passing) ✅
  - All original tests (88/88 passing) ✅

- Updated all components to use consistent styling:
  - Timeline, StrategySelector, PromptInput
  - FileTree, FileViewer, App layout
- Maintained semantic colors for meaningful differentiation
- Removed inconsistent styles (mixed border radius, focus states, etc.)

### Timeline Improvements
- Added real timestamps to all events (messages, tool calls, results)
- Fixed chronological ordering - events now appear in proper sequence
- Added timestamp display (HH:MM:SS.mmm format) in top-right corner
- Improved tool call modal with better parameter/result formatting

### Client Refactoring Phase 1 (Latest - Component Extraction) ✅
**New Reusable Components**:
- `EmptyState` - Centralized empty state component with icon, title, description, action
  - Replaced 5 duplicated empty state patterns
  - Full Storybook stories with 6 variants
  - ~50+ lines of duplication eliminated

- `FilterButton` - Reusable filter button with color variants
  - Replaced 6 repeated button patterns in LogViewer
  - Supports 6 color variants (gray, purple, yellow, blue, amber, red)
  - ~36 lines saved with better maintainability

**Code Duplication Fixed**:
- `ToolCallDisplay` - Removed 70+ lines of duplicated `renderToolParameters`
  - Now imports shared utility from `lib/tool-utils.tsx`
  - Consistent tool rendering across Timeline and ToolCallDisplay

**Storybook Configuration Fixed**:
- Updated to use `@storybook/react-vite` (Storybook 9.0+ requirement)
- Previously incorrect imports from `@storybook/react` (not installed)
- All typechecks now pass with correct framework-specific imports

**Impact**: 150+ lines saved, 12 DRY violations fixed, improved maintainability

## Maintenance

### Cleanup Script

The project includes a cleanup script to remove old generated applications and reset the database:

**Location**: `scripts/cleanup-generations.ts`

**Usage**:
```bash
cd server && pnpm exec tsx ../scripts/cleanup-generations.ts
```

**What it does**:
1. **Database Cleanup**:
   - Deletes all sessions from the database
   - Cascade deletes all related timeline items and files
   - Shows progress for each deleted session

2. **Disk Cleanup**:
   - Removes all generated application directories from `generated/`
   - Preserves `.gitkeep` file for Git tracking
   - Reports freed disk space (typically ~50-100MB per app)

**Example Output**:
```
🧹 Starting cleanup...

📊 Cleaning up database...
   Found 7 sessions in database
   ✓ Deleted session: 00cfa079... (Drawing game - one person draws, another guesses...)
   ✅ Database cleaned (7 sessions removed)

💾 Cleaning up disk...
   ✓ Removed: 00cfa079-5818-400c-b1a5-40c0d4524fc0 (80.94 MB)
   ✅ Disk cleaned (16 directories removed, 988.59 MB freed)

✨ Cleanup complete!
```

**When to use**:
- Before long development sessions to free up disk space
- After testing multiple app generations
- When the `generated/` directory becomes too large (>1GB)
- To reset the database for fresh testing

**Note**: The database will be automatically re-initialized with the proper schema when the server starts next time.

## Environment Variables

Server requires `.env` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
PORT=3001
```

  - HTTP access validation and log retrieval
- Test documentation: See TESTING.md for complete guide

## Important Implementation Details

### Timestamp Management
All events include `timestamp: Date.now()` at emission time:
- Server emits timestamps via `emitMessage()`, `emitToolCall()`, `emitToolResult()`
- Client stores timestamps in state
- Timeline component sorts all events by timestamp for proper ordering

### WebSocket State Management
Client hook (`useWebSocket.ts`) manages:
- Connection state
- Message arrays (with 100 message limit)
- Tool call/result tracking
- File update tracking
- Generation state

### Error Handling
- ErrorBoundary wraps Timeline component
- WebSocket reconnection logic
- Tool execution error capture and display

## Known Limitations

1. Limited persistence - database stores sessions/timeline/files but UI state is lost on page refresh (no session restoration UI yet)
2. Single active generation at a time
3. File viewer uses client-side syntax highlighting (limited language support)
4. No authentication or multi-user support
5. Docker required for app execution:
   - Automatic detection supports Docker Desktop, Colima, and standard Linux Docker
   - Clear error messages if Docker is unavailable
   - No WebContainer fallback for browser-based execution (future consideration)
6. Generated apps use SQLite (simple but not production-ready for concurrent access)
7. No automatic code formatting/linting in generated apps
8. Manual cleanup required - use cleanup script to free disk space (no automatic retention policy)

## Future Considerations

- Complete session persistence (UI for browsing/restoring previous sessions)
- Automatic cleanup with configurable retention policies (e.g., delete generations older than 7 days)
- Implement streaming for large file outputs
- Add diff view for file changes
- Support for multiple concurrent generations
- Cost tracking and budgeting features
- More sophisticated strategy implementations (compiler checks, building blocks, templates)
- WebContainer integration as Docker alternative for browser-based execution
- Support for PostgreSQL/MySQL in addition to SQLite
- Deployment integration (Vercel, Railway, Fly.io)
- Code quality improvements: automatic formatting (Prettier), linting (ESLint)
- Multi-database support in single app (separate DBs for client/server)
