- ✅ High rate limits (good for demos)
- ⚠️ Lower code quality than GPT-4.1
- ⚠️ Less efficient tool calling

**Best for**: Development phase, budget-conscious demos, high-volume testing

---

### 4. GPT-4-Turbo (Legacy)
**Strengths**:
- ✅ Faster and cheaper than original GPT-4
- ⚠️ Slower and more expensive than GPT-4o
- ⚠️ Text-only (no multimodal)
- ⚠️ Superseded by GPT-4o and GPT-4.1

**Status**: Not recommended (superseded by newer models)

---

## Recommendation by Phase

### Phase 2 (Current): Development & Testing
**Primary Model**: `gpt-4o`
- Fast iteration cycles
- Cost-effective for development
- High rate limits for testing
- Good enough for proof-of-concept

**Why not GPT-4.1 yet?**
- Save budget during development
- GPT-4o is sufficient for building the pipeline
- Switch to GPT-4.1 once core functionality works

### Phase 5+: Production & Demos
**Primary Model**: `gpt-4-1` (or latest GPT-4.x)
- Best code generation quality
- More efficient tool calling (critical for our 4 tools)
- Fewer extraneous edits = better demo UX
- Professional-quality output

**Alternative for "Plan First" Strategy**: `o4-mini`
- Superior reasoning for complex planning
- Better at architectural decisions
- Good for showcasing advanced strategies

## Cost Comparison (Estimated 2025 Pricing)

| Model | Input ($/1M tokens) | Output ($/1M tokens) | Use Case |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------|----------|
| GPT-4.1 | Higher | Higher | Production demos |
| o3-mini/o4-mini | Highest | Highest | Advanced reasoning |
| GPT-4o | Medium | Medium | Development/testing |
| GPT-4-Turbo | Higher than 4o | Higher than 4o | Legacy |

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 2 (Now)
```typescript
// Start with GPT-4o for development
const model = openai('gpt-4o');
```

### Phase 5 (Optimization Strategies)
```typescript
// Strategy-specific model selection
const models = {
  naive: openai('gpt-4o'),          // Fast, cost-effective
  planFirst: openai('o4-mini'),     // Advanced reasoning
  template: openai('gpt-4-1'),      // Best code quality
  compilerCheck: openai('gpt-4-1'), // Iterative refinement
  buildingBlocks: openai('gpt-4-1') // Complex composition
};
```

### Production Demos
```typescript
// Use GPT-4.1 for best results
const model = openai('gpt-4-1');
```

---

## Context Window Considerations

All modern models support large context windows (128K+ tokens):
- Sufficient for entire app context
- Can include multiple files, compilation errors, and conversation history
- No need to heavily prune context for most demos

---

## Tool Calling Performance

**GPT-4.1** is specifically optimized for tool calling:
- 30% more efficient than GPT-4o
- Better at chaining multiple tool calls
- Fewer hallucinated tool parameters
- More reliable with Zod schema validation

This is critical for our use case with 4 tools:
- `writeFile` - Most frequently used
- `readFile` - For context and iteration
- `listFiles` - For exploration
- `executeCommand` - For builds and testing

---

## Final Recommendation

### Start with: `gpt-4o`
- Perfect for Phase 2 development
- Fast feedback loops
- Cost-effective testing
- Sufficient for building the infrastructure

### Upgrade to: `gpt-4-1`
- Switch before public demos
- Superior code quality
- More efficient tool calling
- Professional output

### Special Cases: `o4-mini`
- Use for "Plan First" strategy demo
- Showcase advanced reasoning capabilities
- Demonstrate planning vs direct coding

---

## Configuration in Code

```typescript
// server/src/config/models.ts
export const MODEL_CONFIG = {
  development: 'gpt-4o',     // Fast, cost-effective
  production: 'gpt-4-1',     // Best quality
  reasoning: 'o4-mini',      // Advanced planning
} as const;

// Use based on environment
const model = openai(
  process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    ? MODEL_CONFIG.production
    : MODEL_CONFIG.development
);
```

---

## Monitoring & Metrics

Track these metrics to validate model choice:
1. **Code quality**: Does generated app work on first try?
2. **Tool efficiency**: How many unnecessary tool calls?
3. **Iteration count**: How many rounds to complete task?
4. **Token usage**: Cost per generated app
5. **User satisfaction**: Clean, working code?

Switch models if:
- GPT-4o produces too many errors → upgrade to GPT-4.1
- Simple apps work well → stick with GPT-4o to save costs
- Complex planning needed → try o4-mini
