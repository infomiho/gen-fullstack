# Session Analysis Cookbook

**A step-by-step guide for analyzing Gen Fullstack sessions to understand failures and improve the system.**

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Database location
DB_PATH="/Users/ilakovac/dev/gen-fullstack/server/data/gen-fullstack.db"

# Generated files location
GEN_PATH="/Users/ilakovac/dev/gen-fullstack/generated"

# Example session ID
SESSION_ID="5083b604-8829-4fae-93b3-af8fad133c82"
```

## Database Schema Reference

### sessions table
```
id                  TEXT PRIMARY KEY
prompt              TEXT NOT NULL (original user input)
full_user_prompt    TEXT (full prompt sent to LLM, may include context)
system_prompt       TEXT (system prompt sent to LLM)
capability_config   TEXT NOT NULL (JSON)
status              TEXT NOT NULL (pending/generating/completed/failed/cancelled)
created_at          INTEGER (timestamp_ms)
updated_at          INTEGER (timestamp_ms)
completed_at        INTEGER (timestamp_ms)
error_message       TEXT
input_tokens        INTEGER
output_tokens       INTEGER
total_tokens        INTEGER
cost                TEXT
duration_ms         INTEGER
step_count          INTEGER
```

**Note**: `system_prompt` and `full_user_prompt` were added recently. Older sessions will have NULL values for these columns.

### timeline_items table
```
id                  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
session_id          TEXT NOT NULL
timestamp           INTEGER NOT NULL (timestamp_ms)
type                TEXT NOT NULL (message/tool_call/tool_result)
-- For type='message':
message_id          TEXT
role                TEXT (user/assistant/system)
content             TEXT
-- For type='tool_call':
tool_call_id        TEXT
tool_name           TEXT
tool_args           TEXT (JSON)
tool_reason         TEXT
-- For type='tool_result':
tool_result_id      TEXT
tool_result_for     TEXT (references tool_call_id)
result              TEXT
is_error            INTEGER (0 or 1)
```

### files table
```
id                  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
session_id          TEXT NOT NULL
path                TEXT NOT NULL
content             TEXT NOT NULL
created_at          INTEGER (timestamp_ms)
updated_at          INTEGER (timestamp_ms)
```

## Step-by-Step Analysis Process

### Step 1: Get Session Overview

**Purpose**: Understand what was requested, what strategy was used, and whether it succeeded.

```bash
sqlite3 "$DB_PATH" <<EOF
.headers on
.mode column
SELECT
  id,
  substr(prompt, 1, 80) || '...' as prompt_preview,
  capability_config,
  status,
  datetime(created_at/1000, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') as created,
  datetime(completed_at/1000, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') as completed,
  error_message,
  input_tokens,
  output_tokens,
  duration_ms,
  step_count
FROM sessions
WHERE id = '$SESSION_ID';
EOF
```

**What to check**:
- ‚úÖ **status**: 'completed' = success, 'failed' = something went wrong
- ‚úÖ **error_message**: If status='failed', this tells you what broke
- ‚úÖ **capability_config**: Which strategy was used (naive, plan-first, template, compiler-check)
- ‚úÖ **duration_ms**: How long it took (timeouts are often >120000ms)
- ‚úÖ **step_count**: How many LLM interactions happened

---

### Step 2: Get Full User Prompt

**Purpose**: See exactly what the user asked for.

```bash
sqlite3 "$DB_PATH" <<EOF
.headers off
.mode list
SELECT prompt FROM sessions WHERE id = '$SESSION_ID';
EOF
```

**What to check**:
- Is the prompt clear and specific?
- Does it ask for too many features at once?
- Are there ambiguous requirements?

---

### Step 3: Analyze System and User Prompts (Critical for Finding Root Causes!)

**Purpose**: Examine the actual prompts sent to the LLM to identify incorrect instructions, missing guidance, or contradictions.

**Why this matters**: Many failures stem from **what the LLM was told to do**, not what it actually did. If the system prompt says "use ts-node-dev" but the template uses "tsx", the LLM will generate broken apps no matter how smart it is.

#### 3a. Extract System Prompt

```bash
# System prompt is stored in the database (added recently, older sessions may not have it)
sqlite3 "$DB_PATH" <<EOF
.headers off
.mode list
SELECT COALESCE(system_prompt, '‚ùå System prompt not found (old session)')
FROM sessions
WHERE id = '$SESSION_ID';
EOF
```

**Alternative** (save to file for easier reading):
```bash
sqlite3 "$DB_PATH" "SELECT system_prompt FROM sessions WHERE id = '$SESSION_ID';" > /tmp/system-prompt.txt
cat /tmp/system-prompt.txt
```

**What to check**:
- ‚úÖ **Dependency versions**: Does it specify exact versions or let LLM guess?
  - ‚ùå BAD: "Use Tailwind CSS 4" (LLM guesses `@tailwindcss/vite@^1.0.0` which doesn't exist)
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: "Use @tailwindcss/vite@^4.0.27 and tailwindcss@^4.0.27"

- ‚úÖ **Tool availability**: Does it mention tools that aren't available for this input mode?
  - ‚ùå BAD: Prompt for `inputMode: 'naive'` says "use installNpmDep" but tool is filtered out
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: Prompt for `inputMode: 'naive'` says "write complete package.json", prompt for `inputMode: 'template'` says "use installNpmDep"

- ‚úÖ **Dev script instructions**: Does it specify the correct dev runner?
  - ‚ùå BAD: No mention of tsx vs ts-node-dev (LLM guesses wrong one)
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: "Use tsx for server dev script: `PORT=3000 tsx watch src/index.ts`"

- ‚úÖ **Configuration consistency**: Do instructions match the actual template?
  - ‚ùå BAD: Prompt says "use Vite 5" but template has Vite 7
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: Prompt versions match template's package.json

- ‚úÖ **Contradictions**: Are there conflicting instructions?
  - ‚ùå BAD: Base prompt says "write package.json with writeFile" AND "use installNpmDep" (which should it do?)
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: Clear separation - naive uses writeFile, template uses installNpmDep

#### 3b. Extract User Prompts (from database)

```bash
# Original user input
echo "=== Original User Prompt ==="
sqlite3 "$DB_PATH" <<EOF
.headers off
.mode list
SELECT prompt FROM sessions WHERE id = '$SESSION_ID';
EOF

echo ""
echo "=== Full User Prompt (sent to LLM) ==="
# This includes any system-added context or formatting
sqlite3 "$DB_PATH" <<EOF
.headers off
.mode list
SELECT COALESCE(full_user_prompt, '‚ùå Full prompt not found (old session)')
FROM sessions WHERE id = '$SESSION_ID';
EOF
```

**What to check**:
- Is it asking for features that require multi-user coordination?
- Does it mention specific tech (React Router, Tailwind) that might need special handling?
- Are there implied requirements not explicitly stated?
- Does the full prompt add helpful context, or does it confuse the LLM?

#### 3c. Compare Against Template (if inputMode: 'template')

```bash
# Check what versions the template actually uses
echo "=== Template Versions ==="
cat "$GEN_PATH/../templates/vite-fullstack-base/client/package.json" | grep -A20 '"dependencies":'
cat "$GEN_PATH/../templates/vite-fullstack-base/server/package.json" | grep -A15 '"dependencies":'
```

**What to check**:
- Do system prompt versions match template versions?
- Does the prompt mention template features (Tailwind 4, React Router 7)?
- Are there mismatches that would confuse the LLM?

#### 3d. Check Capability Config (what configuration was used)

```bash
sqlite3 "$DB_PATH" <<EOF
.headers off
.mode list
SELECT capability_config FROM sessions WHERE id = '$SESSION_ID';
EOF
```

**What to check**:
- `inputMode`: 'naive' or 'template'
- `planning`: true/false
- `compilerChecks`: true/false
- `buildingBlocks`: true/false

**Cross-check**: Does the system prompt match the inputMode?
- `inputMode: 'naive'` should NOT mention template-specific features
- `inputMode: 'template'` should NOT tell LLM to create config files (they already exist)

#### 3e. Common Prompt Issues (Real Examples)

**Issue 1: Version Guessing** (Session 534dd3c2)
```
‚ùå PROBLEM: Prompt said "Use Tailwind CSS 4" without version
ü§ñ LLM GUESSED: @tailwindcss/vite@^1.0.0 (doesn't exist!)
üí• RESULT: npm install failed with "404 Not Found"

‚úÖ FIX: Added "COMMON DEPENDENCY VERSIONS" section to base prompt
```

**Issue 2: Wrong Dev Runner** (Session 93307df0)
```
‚ùå PROBLEM: Prompt didn't specify tsx vs ts-node-dev
ü§ñ LLM GUESSED: ts-node-dev (doesn't work with ES modules!)
üí• RESULT: "Must use import to load ES Module" error

‚úÖ FIX: Added "SERVER DEV SCRIPT" section mandating tsx
```

**Issue 3: Tool Availability Mismatch** (Session 534dd3c2)
```
‚ùå PROBLEM: Base prompt mentioned installNpmDep in naive mode
ü§ñ LLM CALLED: installNpmDep before package.json existed
üí• RESULT: Tool failed, wasted tool calls, confused LLM

‚úÖ FIX: Filtered installNpmDep from naive mode, updated base prompt
```

**Issue 4: Missing Coordination Guidance** (Session 5083b604)
```
‚ùå PROBLEM: No prompt guidance on multi-user state sync
ü§ñ LLM GENERATED: Perfect components but no polling logic
üí• RESULT: Players stuck in lobby, can't detect when host starts round

‚úÖ FIX: Need to add multi-user patterns to system prompt (TODO)
```

#### 3f. Prompt Analysis Checklist

When analyzing prompts, check these critical areas:

**Dependency Management**:
- [ ] Exact versions specified for all major dependencies?
- [ ] Versions match template (if template mode)?
- [ ] Versions are actually published to npm?

**Tool Instructions**:
- [ ] Tool availability matches inputMode (naive vs template)?
- [ ] Clear workflow (write vs merge dependencies)?
- [ ] No contradictory instructions?

**Configuration**:
- [ ] Dev scripts specified (tsx, not ts-node-dev)?
- [ ] Vite config mentioned (especially for Tailwind 4)?
- [ ] React Router setup explained?

**Multi-User Guidance** (for apps with multiple user roles):
- [ ] Polling/coordination patterns mentioned?
- [ ] State sync requirements explained?
- [ ] Query param flow guidance?

**Architecture Patterns**:
- [ ] Monorepo structure clear?
- [ ] File organization specified?
- [ ] API endpoint conventions mentioned?

---

### Step 4: Analyze Timeline (Overview)

**Purpose**: See the flow of messages and tool calls.

**Note**: Steps 3a-3f above are CRITICAL for finding root causes. Don't skip prompt analysis!

```bash
sqlite3 "$DB_PATH" <<EOF
.headers on
.mode column
SELECT
  id,
  datetime(timestamp/1000, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') as time,
  type,
  role,
  tool_name,
  CASE
    WHEN type = 'message' THEN substr(content, 1, 60) || '...'
    WHEN type = 'tool_call' THEN tool_name || '(' || substr(tool_args, 1, 40) || '...)'
    WHEN type = 'tool_result' AND is_error = 1 THEN 'ERROR: ' || substr(result, 1, 60)
    WHEN type = 'tool_result' THEN 'Success'
  END as summary
FROM timeline_items
WHERE session_id = '$SESSION_ID'
ORDER BY timestamp ASC;
EOF
```

**What to check**:
- ‚úÖ **Flow**: user message ‚Üí assistant message ‚Üí tool calls ‚Üí tool results ‚Üí repeat
- ‚úÖ **Errors**: Look for `is_error = 1` in tool_result rows
- ‚úÖ **Stuck patterns**: Same tool called repeatedly with errors
- ‚úÖ **Abrupt ending**: Generation ended without completion message

---

### Step 4: Deep Dive into Messages

**Purpose**: See what the LLM was thinking and planning.

```bash
sqlite3 "$DB_PATH" <<EOF
.headers on
.mode list
.separator '\n---\n'
SELECT
  '[' || datetime(timestamp/1000, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') || '] ' ||
  role || ': ' || content
FROM timeline_items
WHERE session_id = '$SESSION_ID' AND type = 'message'
ORDER BY timestamp ASC;
EOF
```

**What to check**:
- First assistant message often contains the plan
- Look for misunderstandings or wrong assumptions
- Check if LLM acknowledged all requirements from prompt

---

### Step 5: Deep Dive into Tool Calls

**Purpose**: See what files were created and what commands were run.

```bash
# Get all tool calls with their arguments
sqlite3 "$DB_PATH" <<EOF
.headers on
.mode list
SELECT
  '[' || tool_name || ']
Reason: ' || tool_reason || '
Args: ' || tool_args || '
---'
FROM timeline_items
WHERE session_id = '$SESSION_ID' AND type = 'tool_call'
ORDER BY timestamp ASC;
EOF
```

**What to check**:
- ‚úÖ **writeFile**: Check file paths and content being written
- ‚úÖ **readFile**: See what files LLM is reading (debugging itself?)
- ‚úÖ **getFileTree**: Check if LLM is exploring the directory structure
- ‚úÖ **validateTypeScript/validatePrismaSchema**: Check validation results (if enabled)
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **executeCommand** (deprecated): Old sessions may have this; command execution now happens in Docker phases

---

### Step 6: Deep Dive into Tool Results (Errors)

**Purpose**: Find the actual errors that stopped generation.

```bash
sqlite3 "$DB_PATH" <<EOF
.headers on
.mode list
SELECT
  '[ERROR in ' || tool_result_for || ']
' || result || '
---'
FROM timeline_items
WHERE session_id = '$SESSION_ID'
  AND type = 'tool_result'
  AND is_error = 1
ORDER BY timestamp ASC;
EOF
```

**What to check**:
- ‚úÖ **File system errors**: Permission denied, path not found
- ‚úÖ **Command errors**: npm install failures, TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ **Syntax errors**: Malformed JSON, invalid file paths
- ‚úÖ **Timeout errors**: Commands taking too long

---

### Step 7: Check Generated Files

**Purpose**: See what files were actually created on disk.

```bash
# List all files in the generated session directory
ls -lR "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null || echo "‚ùå Generated directory not found"

# Check if key files exist
echo "=== Key Files ==="
test -f "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/package.json" && echo "‚úÖ package.json" || echo "‚ùå package.json"
test -f "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/client/package.json" && echo "‚úÖ client/package.json" || echo "‚ùå client/package.json"
test -f "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/server/package.json" && echo "‚úÖ server/package.json" || echo "‚ùå server/package.json"
test -f "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/prisma/schema.prisma" && echo "‚úÖ prisma/schema.prisma" || echo "‚ùå prisma/schema.prisma"
```

**What to check**:
- ‚úÖ **Directory structure**: Does it match the expected monorepo layout?
- ‚úÖ **File presence**: Are all critical files there?
- ‚úÖ **File sizes**: Are any files suspiciously small (empty) or large (too much code)?

---

### Step 8: Read Specific Generated Files

**Purpose**: Examine the actual code to find issues.

```bash
# Check package.json files
echo "=== Root package.json ==="
cat "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/package.json"

echo "=== Prisma Schema ==="
cat "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/prisma/schema.prisma"

echo "=== Server main file ==="
cat "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/server/src/index.ts" 2>/dev/null || echo "Not found"

echo "=== Client main file ==="
cat "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/client/src/main.tsx" 2>/dev/null || echo "Not found"
```

**What to check**:
- ‚úÖ **Dependencies**: Are all required packages in package.json?
- ‚úÖ **Prisma schema**: Valid syntax? Missing fields?
- ‚úÖ **Imports**: Are paths correct?
- ‚úÖ **API endpoints**: Do they match the schema?

---

### Step 9: Query Database for Files (Alternative)

**Purpose**: Check what files are stored in the database (may differ from disk).

```bash
sqlite3 "$DB_PATH" <<EOF
.headers on
.mode column
SELECT
  path,
  length(content) as size_bytes,
  datetime(updated_at/1000, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') as last_updated
FROM files
WHERE session_id = '$SESSION_ID'
ORDER BY path;
EOF
```

**What to check**:
- ‚úÖ **File count**: Should have 10-20 files for a typical app
- ‚úÖ **Zero-size files**: Indicates writeFile might have failed
- ‚úÖ **File paths**: Should match expected structure

---

### Step 10: Read File Content from Database

**Purpose**: Get exact file content as written by LLM.

```bash
# Example: Read package.json from database
sqlite3 "$DB_PATH" <<EOF
.headers off
.mode list
SELECT content
FROM files
WHERE session_id = '$SESSION_ID'
  AND path = 'package.json';
EOF
```

---

### Step 11: Navigation Path Analysis (Critical for Multi-Page Apps)

**Purpose**: Verify all routes are reachable and query params flow correctly.

```bash
# Extract all routes and navigation calls
echo "=== Defined Routes ==="
grep -r "path=" "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/client/src" 2>/dev/null | grep -E "<Route"

echo "=== Navigation Calls ==="
grep -rn "navigate(" "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/client/src" 2>/dev/null

echo "=== Link Components ==="
grep -rn "<Link to=" "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/client/src" 2>/dev/null

echo "=== useParams() Usage ==="
grep -rn "useParams" "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/client/src" 2>/dev/null
```

**What to check**:
- ‚ùå **Orphaned routes**: Routes defined in `<Route>` but no `navigate()` or `<Link>` points to them
- ‚ùå **Missing params**: Route expects `:playerId` but navigation doesn't pass `?playerId=...`
- ‚ùå **Broken chains**: User journey requires params to flow from Page A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C, but B doesn't pass params to C
- ‚ùå **Dead ends**: Page has no way to navigate away (no links, no back button logic)

**Example Issue**:
```tsx
// Route defined: /play/:code/rounds/:roundId
<Route path="/play/:code/rounds/:roundId" element={<PlayerRound />} />

// But NO navigation to it anywhere in PlayerLobby!
// Players can never reach this page ‚Üí orphaned route
```

---

### Step 12: Multi-User Coordination Check (Critical for Multi-Player Apps)

**Purpose**: Detect missing real-time sync logic between different user roles.

```bash
echo "=== Polling/Interval Logic ==="
grep -rn "setInterval\|useEffect.*async" "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/client/src" 2>/dev/null

echo "=== WebSocket Usage ==="
grep -rn "WebSocket\|socket\.io\|ws:" "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null

echo "=== Fetch Calls ==="
grep -rn "fetch(" "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/client/src" 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

**What to check**:
- ‚ùå **No polling for state changes**: Player lobby only fetches once, doesn't detect when host starts round
- ‚ùå **Static pages**: Multi-user page that should update in real-time but has no useEffect polling
- ‚ùå **Wrong polling target**: Polls `/players` endpoint but should poll `/game` for full state
- ‚ùå **Missing auto-navigation**: Detects state change but doesn't navigate user to new page

**Example Issue**:
```tsx
// BAD: PlayerLobby only polls for players, won't detect rounds
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchPlayers = async () => {
    const res = await fetch(`/api/games/${code}/players`);
    // Missing: check for game.rounds to detect active round
  };
  setInterval(fetchPlayers, 2000);
}, [code]);

// GOOD: Poll full game state and auto-navigate
useEffect(() => {
  const checkGame = async () => {
    const res = await fetch(`/api/games/${code}`);
    const game = await res.json();
    if (game.rounds.find(r => r.isActive)) {
      navigate(`/play/${code}/rounds/${r.id}?playerId=${playerId}`);
    }
  };
  setInterval(checkGame, 2000);
}, [code, playerId]);
```

---

### Step 13: User Flow Verification (End-to-End Journey)

**Purpose**: Trace the actual user journey to find gaps where users get stuck.

```bash
# Read key pages that coordinate multi-user flows
echo "=== Host Flow Pages ==="
cat "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/client/src/pages/Home.tsx" 2>/dev/null | grep -A5 "createGame\|navigate"
cat "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/client/src/pages/HostLobby.tsx" 2>/dev/null | grep -A5 "useEffect\|navigate"

echo "=== Player Flow Pages ==="
cat "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/client/src/pages/PlayerLobby.tsx" 2>/dev/null | grep -A5 "useEffect\|navigate"
cat "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/client/src/pages/PlayerRound.tsx" 2>/dev/null | grep -A5 "fetch\|submit"
```

**What to check (trace each user role's journey)**:

**Host Journey**:
1. ‚úÖ Home ‚Üí Create game ‚Üí Navigate to HostLobby (check if code is passed)
2. ‚úÖ HostLobby ‚Üí Start round ‚Üí Navigate to HostRound (check if roundId is passed)
3. ‚úÖ HostRound ‚Üí End round ‚Üí Navigate to Results (check if all params present)
4. ‚ùì Results ‚Üí Back to lobby or start new round (is there a navigation path?)

**Player Journey**:
1. ‚úÖ Home ‚Üí Join game ‚Üí Navigate to PlayerLobby (check if playerId is stored/passed)
2. ‚ùå **CRITICAL GAP**: PlayerLobby ‚Üí detect active round ‚Üí auto-navigate to PlayerRound?
3. ‚ùì PlayerRound ‚Üí Submit answer ‚Üí what happens next? (wait for results? poll for results?)
4. ‚ùì Results ‚Üí Back to lobby? (navigation path exists?)

---

### Step 14: Integration Gap Detection (Component-Level)

**Purpose**: Find features that work in isolation but can't be triggered in the full system.

```bash
# Check if backend endpoints have corresponding frontend calls
echo "=== Backend Endpoints ==="
grep -rn "router\.\(get\|post\|put\|delete\)" "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/server/src" 2>/dev/null | head -20

echo "=== Frontend API Calls ==="
grep -rn "fetch.*\/api\/" "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/client/src" 2>/dev/null
```

**What to check**:
- ‚ùå **Unused API endpoints**: Backend has `POST /games/:code/rounds` but no frontend ever calls it
- ‚ùå **Missing UI triggers**: API exists but no button/form to invoke it
- ‚ùå **Incomplete forms**: Form exists but doesn't capture all required API params
- ‚ùå **Display gaps**: Data is fetched but never rendered (e.g., fetches round.prompt but doesn't display it)

**Example Issue**:
```tsx
// Backend has endpoint to create rounds:
router.post('/:code/rounds', async (req, res) => {
  const { prompt, type } = req.body;
  // ...creates round
});

// But HostLobby has no form to create rounds!
// Endpoint is unreachable ‚Üí feature doesn't work
```

---

### Step 15: Data Flow Verification

**Purpose**: Ensure critical data (prompt, scores, etc.) actually gets displayed to users.

```bash
# Check if fetched data is actually rendered
echo "=== Data Fetching ==="
grep -rn "const.*=.*await.*json()" "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/client/src/pages" 2>/dev/null

echo "=== Data Rendering ==="
grep -rn "\.map(\|\.filter(\|{.*\..*}" "$GEN_PATH/$SESSION_ID/client/src/pages" 2>/dev/null | head -30
```

**What to check**:
- ‚ùå **Fetched but not displayed**: Round has `prompt` field but page doesn't show it
- ‚ùå **Display placeholder**: Hard-coded text like "Question: [PROMPT]" instead of actual prompt
- ‚ùå **Missing state updates**: Fetches data but doesn't update useState/useEffect
- ‚ùå **Conditional rendering bugs**: Data hidden by incorrect `if (!data) return null` check

---

## Common Failure Patterns

### Pattern 1: Dependency Installation Timeout
**Symptoms**:
- `error_message` contains "npm install" or "timeout"
- `duration_ms` is high (>120000)
- Tool result has "Command timed out"

**What to look for**:
- Check if package.json has valid dependencies
- Look for network-related errors in tool results
- Check if too many dependencies were specified

**Fix**: Increase timeout or pre-cache dependencies in Docker image

---

### Pattern 2: Prisma Schema Errors
**Symptoms**:
- Tool result contains "prisma validate" or "prisma generate" errors
- Status is 'failed' with Prisma-related error_message

**What to look for**:
- Read prisma/schema.prisma from files table
- Check for syntax errors (missing @id, invalid types)
- Look for invalid relation definitions

**Fix**: Improve Prisma examples in system prompt

---

### Pattern 3: TypeScript Compilation Errors
**Symptoms**:
- Tool result contains "npx tsc --noEmit" errors
- Multiple type errors listed

**What to look for**:
- Read the actual source files
- Check for missing imports
- Look for type mismatches (e.g., using Prisma client before generation)

**Fix**: Ensure compiler-check strategy is used, or improve type definitions in prompts

---

### Pattern 4: Incomplete File Structure
**Symptoms**:
- status = 'completed' but app doesn't work
- Missing key files (vite.config.ts, server/src/index.ts)

**What to look for**:
- Compare file list from Step 9 against expected structure
- Check if generation was cut short (step_count too low)

**Fix**: Increase token budget or tool call limits

---

### Pattern 5: Malformed JSON in package.json
**Symptoms**:
- npm install fails with JSON parse error
- Tool result shows "Invalid JSON"

**What to look for**:
- Read package.json content from database
- Check for trailing commas, missing quotes, invalid characters

**Fix**: Add validation layer before writing JSON files

---

### Pattern 6: Locally Correct, Globally Broken (Most Insidious!)
**Symptoms**:
- status = 'completed' (no errors!)
- All files present and syntactically correct
- Backend endpoints work when tested directly
- UI components render without errors
- **BUT** the app doesn't function as a whole

**What to look for**:
- **Missing coordination logic**: Multi-user apps where users can't sync state
  - Example: Host starts round but players never know about it
- **Orphaned pages**: Routes exist but are unreachable through normal navigation
  - Example: PlayerRound page exists but no link/navigation from PlayerLobby
- **Incomplete user flows**: Journey starts but gets stuck halfway
  - Example: Player joins lobby ‚Üí ??? ‚Üí can't reach the game
- **Missing data display**: Data fetched but not rendered
  - Example: Round prompt exists in DB but PlayerRound doesn't display it
- **Broken param chains**: Query params required but not passed through navigation
  - Example: playerId needed for voting but lost after page transitions

**How to detect**:
1. Run Step 11-15 (Navigation, Coordination, User Flow analysis)
2. Trace each user role's journey from start to finish
3. Look for pages that should update in real-time but have no polling
4. Check if all `<Route>` paths have incoming `navigate()` or `<Link>` calls
5. Verify critical data (prompts, scores) is actually rendered

**Why it happens**:
- LLM generates components in isolation without thinking about coordination
- Planning tool captures static structure (models, routes, pages) but misses dynamic flows
- System prompt lacks guidance on multi-user patterns and state synchronization
- No validation step to check end-to-end user journeys

**Fix (multiple approaches needed)**:
1. **Enhanced planning**: Add `userFlows` and `coordinationRequirements` to planArchitecture tool
2. **Prompt guidance**: Add multi-user coordination patterns to BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT
3. **Post-gen validation**: Run automated navigation and coordination checks
4. **Building blocks**: Create reusable multi-user-sync patterns

**Example from real session** (5083b604-8829-4fae-93b3-af8fad133c82):
```
Problem: Jackbox-style party game generated successfully but players can't play

Root Cause: PlayerLobby only polls for player list, not game state
- Host creates round ‚Üí stored in DB ‚úÖ
- PlayerLobby never detects new round ‚ùå
- Players stuck in lobby forever, can't reach PlayerRound page ‚ùå

Fix needed: Add polling + auto-navigation in PlayerLobby:
  useEffect(() => {
    const checkForRound = setInterval(async () => {
      const game = await fetch(`/api/games/${code}`).then(r => r.json());
      const activeRound = game.rounds.find(r => r.isActive);
      if (activeRound) navigate(`/play/${code}/rounds/${activeRound.id}?playerId=${playerId}`);
    }, 2000);
    return () => clearInterval(checkForRound);
  }, [code, playerId]);
```

## Analysis Report Template

After running through the steps above, summarize findings:

```markdown
## Session Analysis: [SESSION_ID]

### Overview
- **Prompt**: [Brief description]
- **Strategy**: [naive/plan-first/template/compiler-check]
- **Status**: [completed/failed]
- **Duration**: [X seconds]
- **Steps**: [N tool calls]

### Prompt Analysis (Step 3 - CRITICAL!)

**System Prompt Issues**:
- [ ] Dependency versions specified? ‚Üí [List any version-guessing issues]
- [ ] Tool availability matches mode? ‚Üí [installNpmDep in naive? Other mismatches?]
- [ ] Dev script instructions correct? ‚Üí [tsx vs ts-node-dev issue?]
- [ ] Contradictory instructions? ‚Üí [List any conflicts between base and addons]

**Configuration Mismatches**:
- [ ] Prompt versions match template? ‚Üí [List any version discrepancies]
- [ ] Mode-specific guidance correct? ‚Üí [Naive vs template confusion?]

**Missing Guidance**:
- [ ] Multi-user coordination patterns? ‚Üí [Needed but not mentioned?]
- [ ] Architecture guidance? ‚Üí [File structure, naming conventions clear?]

**If prompt issues found**: These are usually the ROOT CAUSE. Fix the prompt before analyzing code.

### Technical Status
‚úÖ **What Works**:
- List only if relevant (e.g., "All files generated", "TypeScript compiles", "Prisma schema valid")

‚ùå **What's Broken** (focus here!):
- [Specific technical errors]
- [Compilation failures]
- [Missing dependencies]

### Critical Gaps (Steps 11-15)

**Navigation Issues**:
- [ ] All routes reachable? ‚Üí [List orphaned routes if any]
- [ ] Query params flow correctly? ‚Üí [List broken param chains if any]
- [ ] Dead ends exist? ‚Üí [List pages with no exit path if any]

**Coordination Issues** (for multi-user apps):
- [ ] Polling for state changes? ‚Üí [Which pages should poll but don't]
- [ ] Auto-navigation on state change? ‚Üí [Which transitions are missing]
- [ ] WebSocket or interval logic present? ‚Üí [Yes/No, details]

**User Flow Completeness**:
- [ ] Host journey: [Trace from start to end, mark ‚ùå where it breaks]
- [ ] Player journey: [Trace from start to end, mark ‚ùå where it breaks]
- [ ] Admin journey (if applicable): [...]

**Integration Gaps**:
- [ ] Unused API endpoints: [List endpoints with no frontend calls]
- [ ] Missing UI triggers: [List features that can't be invoked]
- [ ] Data not displayed: [List fetched but not rendered data]

**Verdict**:
- [ ] Technically correct, functionally complete ‚Üí Ship it! ‚úÖ
- [ ] Technically correct, coordination gaps ‚Üí "Locally correct, globally broken" (Pattern 6) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- [ ] Technical errors ‚Üí Fix compilation/runtime issues first ‚ùå

### Root Cause
[What actually went wrong - be specific. Focus on MISSING logic, not just errors]

### Evidence
- **Navigation gap**: [Specific route/page that's unreachable]
- **Coordination gap**: [Specific useEffect or polling that's missing]
- **User flow break**: [Point in journey where user gets stuck]
- **Timeline observation**: [Relevant pattern from timeline if technical error]
- **Error message**: [Exact error from tool_result or error_message if technical error]

### Why It Happened
[Explain the underlying reason]
- Is this a prompt gap? (missing guidance on multi-user patterns)
- Is this a planning gap? (planArchitecture doesn't capture flows)
- Is this an LLM reasoning gap? (component-by-component thinking)
- Is this a validation gap? (no automated check for this issue)

### Recommendations
1. **Prompt improvement**: [How to improve system prompt - be specific]
2. **Planning tool enhancement**: [What to add to planArchitecture]
3. **Validation**: [New automated check to add]
4. **Building block**: [Reusable pattern to create]

### Related Issues
- Issue #XX - Similar failure pattern
- Issue #YY - Related to [component]

### Success Criteria for Re-Test
After implementing fixes, re-run the same prompt and verify:
- [ ] [Specific gap fixed - e.g., "PlayerLobby polls for game state"]
- [ ] [Specific navigation works - e.g., "Players auto-navigate to rounds"]
- [ ] [Specific data displayed - e.g., "Round prompt shown on PlayerRound"]
- [ ] [End-to-end journey works - e.g., "Host ‚Üí Player full game loop"]
```

## Tips for Effective Analysis

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with session overview, then drill into specific errors
2. **Check timing**: Use timestamps to see how long each phase took
3. **Compare with successful sessions**: Look at a working session to see what differs
4. **Cross-reference**: Database content vs actual files on disk may differ
5. **Look for patterns**: If multiple sessions fail the same way, it's a systemic issue
6. **Test the fix**: After identifying root cause, test with a similar prompt
7. **Document findings**: Create a GitHub issue with your analysis

### üéØ Focus on What's MISSING, Not What's Present

**DO** look for:
- ‚ùå Orphaned routes with no navigation path
- ‚ùå Missing polling logic in multi-user pages
- ‚ùå Broken query param chains
- ‚ùå Fetched data that's never displayed
- ‚ùå API endpoints with no frontend calls
- ‚ùå Pages with no exit/back navigation
- ‚ùå State changes with no coordination

**DON'T** waste time praising:
- ‚úÖ "Clean code structure" (irrelevant if it doesn't work)
- ‚úÖ "Good use of TypeScript" (doesn't matter if flows are broken)
- ‚úÖ "Proper REST API design" (useless if frontend can't call it)
- ‚úÖ "Modern React patterns" (not helpful if coordination is missing)

**Remember**:
> An app with perfect syntax but missing coordination logic is **MORE BROKEN** than an app with type errors but complete user flows.
> Type errors can be fixed in 5 minutes. Missing coordination logic requires redesigning the architecture.

**Analysis Goal**:
Identify **gaps that require architectural thinking**, not just syntax fixes. These are the insights that help improve prompts and strategies.

## Common SQLite Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Wrong**: `SELECT strategy FROM sessions` (column doesn't exist)
‚úÖ **Right**: `SELECT capability_config FROM sessions`

‚ùå **Wrong**: `SELECT args FROM timeline_items WHERE type='tool_call'`
‚úÖ **Right**: `SELECT tool_args FROM timeline_items WHERE type='tool_call'`

‚ùå **Wrong**: `SELECT error FROM timeline_items`
‚úÖ **Right**: `SELECT result FROM timeline_items WHERE is_error = 1`

‚ùå **Wrong**: Using `created` or `updated` (wrong column names)
‚úÖ **Right**: Use `created_at`, `updated_at`, `completed_at`

‚ùå **Wrong**: Forgetting to filter by session_id
‚úÖ **Right**: Always include `WHERE session_id = '$SESSION_ID'`
